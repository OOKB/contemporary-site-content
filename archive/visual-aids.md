For its inaugural exhibition, the Contemporary Museum joined thousands of arts organizations nationwide by participating in “A Day Without Art 1990,” a day of action and mourning in response to the AIDS crisis organized by the New York based group Visual AIDS. Borrowing the group’s name for an exhibition, George Ciscle and Lisa Corrin issued an open call for artworks that address HIV/AIDS to be mailed in to the newlyformed “museum without walls.” Welcoming art in any medium, Ciscle and Corrin committed to a bold, “uncurated” exhibition model that would incorporate many perspectives and stimulate public dialogue. Featuring over 200 works, Ciscle and Corrin conceived Visual AIDS to grow through additional contributions from exhibition visitors and local school children. At the exhibition’s conclusion, the Contemporary donated all submitted artworks to hospitals, AIDS hospices, individuals afflicted with the disease, community centers, and AIDS-related research organizations.
