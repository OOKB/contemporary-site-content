In 1990, as plans for founding the Contemporary were taking shape, independent curator George Ciscle invited twelve regional artists to create works in response to the AIDS crisis. Answering with sculpture, photography, painting, and mixed media, the participating artists issued a collective outcry for healing and action in order to expand public dialogue, awareness, and compassion. _Outcry_, the first AIDS related exhibition of its kind in the Mid-Atlantic region, went on to tour four area venues. By the time _Outcry_ was presented, the Contemporary had been founded, placing _Outcry_ as a prelude to _Visual Aids_.
