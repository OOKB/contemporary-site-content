The Contemporary Museum’s first international exhibition, Photo Manifesto, presented 240 recent photographic works by 43 artists from the former Soviet Union. All of the featured works had been created since the late 1980s and most had never before been seen outside of the USSR. The vacated Greyhound Bus Service Terminal in Downtown Baltimore proved to be an appropriate exhibition context, echoing the “raw” spaces of disused Soviet warehouses and industrial sites that functioned as exhibition spaces for “unofficial” art in the more tolerant climate of the Gorbachev era. Arguing for the importance of creative expression in the formation of a more open society, Photo Manifesto also featured panel discussions, gallery talks, educational programs, film screenings, and an on-site reading room.
